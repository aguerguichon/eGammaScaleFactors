How to make a Ntuple campaign
====================================

1 : Generate MC Pileup File 
---------------------------

- In ZeeAnalysis/python/GeneratePU.py, add the MC AOD dataset(s) corresponding to the DAOD which is used
```
  lsetup panda
```
- Check the latest athena release with the command 
  
  showVersions --show=athena
- Setup Athena (always use the latest release) in eGammaScaleFactors
  
  asetup AthAnalysisBase,X.Y.Z,here 
- Launch your job
  
  python GeneratePU.py

Once the job is finished, download ('rucio download fileName') and merge all the output files ('hadd fileName fileName_prw.root'). The merged file will then be the input file of RunZee.


2 : Running on data
--------------------

- In eGammaScaleFactors/ZeeAnalysis/python/FunctionsRunGrid.py:
   * create a new entry in fileList as: fileList['shortcut']=['full name of dataset', 'config file name']
   * the shortcut name will be the name of the directory where data will be uploaded once the job is finished

- In eGammaScaleFactors/ZeeAnalysis/python/RunGrid.py:
   * create a new key as: 'if key == option: GetDataFiles(inputs, 'shortcut', {'options'}, 'nOptions')

  -> more information on the different nOptions in FunctionsRunGrid.py l.70

  -> if nOptions > 0, all the selections corresponding to 0 -> nOptions are performed

  -> if nOptions < 0, only the selection corresponding to fabs(nOptions) is performed (baseline is 1)

   ex: 
   - nOptions= 1: 2 different jobs are launched, the 1st one with electronID=1 doScale=0 ptCut=27 and the 2nd one with electronID=1 doScale=1 ptCut=27  
   - nOptions=-1: only one job is launched with electronID=1 doScale=1 ptCut=27

- In eGammaScaleFactors/ZeeAnalysis/Config/:
   * create the config file with:
for MC: esModel, trigger, dataPUSF, pileupFile, ilumCalc
for data: esModel, trigger, dataPUSF, grl
NB: dataPUSF=1.09 (converted into 1/1.09 in the Analysis.cxx code)

- Setup: rcSetup in eGammaScaleFactors, lsetup panda, lsetup rucio
- 'python RunGrid.py'


NB: GridJobList.txt is a list of all jobs which output files haven't been downloaded yet



3 : Downloading output files
----------------------------

- "python RunGrid.py download"

  -> this option of RunGrid.py downloads the output files, merge them into one or several (if there are a lot of events) root files and updates the GridJobList.txt file. It allows to keep track of the different versions

- it also possible to just manually download output files with 'rucio download' and merge files with 'hadd'


Customize the selection and the variables
=========================================

Adding variables to be stored in the ntuple
-------------------------------------------

Knowing what information is stored in the DAOD:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/SoftwareTutorialxAODAnalysisInROOT#Knowing_what_information_is_in_t

To add variables, you have to modify Analysis::FillSelectionTree() in ZeeAnalysis/Root/Analysis.cxx by adding a new line:

m_mapVar['name you want to give to your variable in the tree']= 'the variable'


Adding cuts and selection steps
-------------------------------

In Analysis::PassSelection() are the cuts and selection at the event level
In Analysis::MakeElectronCut() are the cuts and selection at the electron level

To include the new selection in the cut flow: 
-add the 'key' name of the selection in the vector cutFlowNames in the Analysis constructor
-add the following line after your selection:'m_mapHist["cutFlow"]->Fill('key')'


Tools
=====

Tools are declared as attributes of the Analysis class. They are initialized in Analysis::InitializeTools()
